This directory is for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) interface files.
Each file (e.g., crud_users.php, crud_achievements.php) will manage a specific database table.
These interfaces should provide:
- List view with search and filter capabilities.
- Forms for creating new records.
- Forms for editing existing records.
- Functionality to delete records (with confirmation).
