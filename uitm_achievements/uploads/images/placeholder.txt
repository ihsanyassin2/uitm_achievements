This directory is for storing uploaded images related to achievements.
Ensure this directory is writable by the web server.
Consider creating subdirectories (e.g., by year/month or by user ID) if many images are expected, to keep it organized.
Example: /uploads/images/2023/11/image.jpg
         /uploads/images/user_123/image.jpg

Also, implement security measures:
1. Validate file types (allow only jpg, png, gif, etc.).
2. Sanitize filenames.
3. Limit file sizes.
4. Do not allow execution of scripts in this directory (e.g., via .htaccess if on Apache).
