This directory is intended for storing PHP error logs and other application logs.
Ensure this directory is writable by the web server process in a production environment if file-based logging is enabled.
For security, if this 'logs' directory is within the web root, ensure direct web access to log files is prevented (e.g., via .htaccess rules if on Apache).

Example .htaccess for this logs directory:
<IfModule mod_authz_core.c>
    Require all denied
</IfModule>
<IfModule !mod_authz_core.c>
    Order deny,allow
    Deny from all
</IfModule>
